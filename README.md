# Mojo - LangTrain
We developed LangTrain to the make it easier to teach LLMs your weird programming lanugage.  Interanaly we use a progrmaming language called LL that is propritary to us.  It is clear that no LLM like codellama or GPT4 has been trained on such a language.  That is why we built LangTrain.
